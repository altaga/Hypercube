# Introduction:

In industries where security is critical, managing costs without compromising safety is a constant challenge. AI-powered security systems offer a game-changing solution by using machine learning and real-time data to optimize surveillance and monitoring processes. These intelligent systems not only enhance safety but also streamline operations, significantly reducing expenses related to manual monitoring, equipment maintenance, and response times. By automating threat detection and minimizing resource use, AI-driven security ensures a safer environment at a fraction of traditional costs.

# Problem:

Traditional security systems are expensive to operate due to high labor demands, resource inefficiencies, and outdated technology that requires constant maintenance. These costs quickly add up, especially in environments that require 24/7 monitoring. Moreover, reactive measures lead to increased expenses from delayed responses and unnecessary resource use. Thereâ€™s a critical need for a cost-effective, optimized solution that leverages AI to automate threat detection, reduce manual oversight, and ultimately save money while enhancing security.
